I so regret it. We bought the house in 08/2018. The panels were installed in January of 2017.
We were led to believe that the only option of buying the home was assuming the lease on the panels.
We were also led to believe the panels would generate enough to negate the electric bill. Fast forward 4 years.
There have been less than 4 months out of the last 48 where what SunRun panels generated was enough to negate the usage.
In addition to the fact they are virtually useless the cost per unit is 2 cents higher than local BGE (Balt. Gas & Electric) they also have built into the agreement that their price will consistently be 2 cents more.
We have electric and gas.
in the cold months your gas bills will still be high for which Electric/Solar does nothing.
Our average annual usage is around 11,000 (average family of 4) and the panels produce 6,500. You do the math. We were misled from jump by SunRun, the Sellers, and the Listing Agent. 
And now we are stuck. If I want the system gone I have to pay about 12K to payoff the lease on the panels and who knows how much to have them removed and likely need to repair my roof after that.

Lesson learned
1) Never lease solar
2) If you do, only do so if you have all electric
3) make sure the amount of panels is sufficient/greater than the amount estimated for family size otherwise you are screwed
4) You better be in a climate where panels are best utilized they are less efficient at the extremes. 
5) If you still get solar don't get it from SunRun/Vivint or SolarCity they make up for 56% of the complaints.
